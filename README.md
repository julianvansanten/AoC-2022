# Advent of Code 2022

An Advent of Code solution for the year 2022. I will try to make as much solutions as possible in Haskell until I get bored.

## Installing and developing

First off, make sure you have installed [GHCup](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/) to manage all Haskell tools.

Using GHCup, install cabal and stack.

Then, use `cabal update` to build and install all dependencies.

Stack is used to build, run and test the program. Use the following functions respectively:

- `stack build`
- `stack run`
- `stack test`
